# KDC101
 ## KDC101 K-Cube Brushed DC Servo Motor Controller for Motorized Stages

The **KDC101** K-Cube from Thorlabs is a brushed DC servo motor controller designed for precise control of motorized stages, such as linear translation or rotational stages. It is ideal for both simple manual operations and more complex automated positioning in a range of experimental and industrial applications. The **KDC101** can be used to achieve sub-micron precision, making it suitable for optics alignment, mechanical adjustments, and other applications requiring high-precision control.

### Key Features
- **Control Modes**: Offers **velocity control**, **jog mode**, and **go-to-position mode**. This versatility allows for different types of precise movement control depending on the requirements of the application:
  - **Velocity Control Mode**: Move with a speed proportional to the wheel deflection.
  - **Jog Mode**: Allows repeated movement in set increments.
  - **Go-To-Position Mode**: Quickly move between predefined positions.

- **Trigger Input/Output**: Equipped with two trigger ports (TRIG1 and TRIG2) that can be configured as either inputs or outputs, allowing seamless integration into automated workflows. Trigger ports can:
  - **Input**: Be used for triggering relative, absolute, or homing movements.
  - **Output**: Be set to indicate motor status or trigger at pre-defined positions during motor movement.

- **Joystick Control**: The top panel joystick can be customized to fit the user's requirements. Parameters such as maximum velocity, acceleration, direction, and preset positions can be set, allowing intuitive manual control of the motor.

- **Digital Outputs and Limit Switches**: The KDC101 allows configuration of **limit switches** for motor safety, including clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) switches to prevent over-travel. This helps ensure safe and reliable operation of the motor.

- **PID Control**: The controller uses a **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative)** control loop for precise control of the motor position. These parameters can be adjusted for fine-tuning system responsiveness and stability, providing accurate control for both simple and complex motions.

### Integration with Motorized Stages
The KDC101 is well-suited for integration with motorized stages and actuators in precision applications, allowing fine movement control. The controller can be operated via a **manual interface** using the front panel joystick or through **software control**, making it suitable for use in automated experiments or industrial applications requiring programmatic control of movement.

- **Motor Positioning**: Supports both **absolute positioning** for reaching exact target locations and **relative moves** for incremental positioning. Additionally, the homing capability enables precise resetting to a reference starting point.
  
- **Velocity and Jogging Parameters**: You can set jog and velocity parameters to define the acceleration, speed, and movement increments, making it possible to customize the motion profile for a particular experiment or application.

### Usage Scenarios
- **Optics Alignment**: The KDC101's high precision and ability to easily control the movement of translation or rotational stages make it ideal for aligning optical elements.
- **Automated Positioning**: The trigger input/output and programmatic control capabilities make the KDC101 an excellent option for inclusion in automated experimental setups where motorized movement is synchronized with other processes.
- **Manual Adjustment**: The top panel joystick and preset buttons provide an intuitive interface for users who need manual control, with adjustable brightness and timeout features for user convenience.

### Key Specifications
- **Control Modes**: Velocity control, jog mode, go-to-position mode.
- **Trigger I/O**: Two bidirectional trigger ports configurable as either input or output.
- **Joystick Customization**: Customizable parameters for controlling motor movement.
- **Motor Feedback**: Closed-loop control with PID tuning for precise control.

The **KDC101** is an advanced, compact controller that integrates seamlessly into motorized systems requiring precision and flexibility. It is suitable for labs and industrial environments where high performance and integration flexibility are required.
