# KSC101

## Brushed DC Servo Motor Controller for Motorized Stages

The **KSC101** K-Cube by Thorlabs is a brushed DC servo motor controller that is used to precisely control **motorized stages** such as linear translation stages or rotational stages. The KSC101 provides accurate control and feedback mechanisms, making it ideal for automated positioning in optical and mechanical systems. This controller offers various operation modes and customization options, including:

- **Velocity Control**: Manages the speed of the motor for smooth transitions, useful for applications needing controlled motion without abrupt changes.
- **Jog and Go-To-Position Modes**: Enables precise positioning by either incremental jogging or specifying an exact position to move to. Ideal for applications that require accurate repositioning.
- **Trigger Input/Output Configuration**: The KSC101 supports advanced trigger configurations for motor movement events, allowing integration into larger automated workflows with triggers for relative, absolute, or homing moves.

The KSC101 can be controlled either manually via a joystick or through software, making it suitable for both standalone applications and automated experimental setups. This flexibility is key when incorporating the motor controller into systems where dynamic adjustments or precise motor control are required.

## Integration Features
- **Motor Positioning**: Supports setting absolute positions for motorized stages, which is vital for alignment and positioning tasks. The absolute position is measured in encoder counts, allowing for sub-micron precision.
- **Joystick Customization**: The KSC101 provides adjustable parameters for the joystick, including velocity control, acceleration, direction sensing, and preset positions. This allows users to interact with the device in ways suited to their application.
- **LED and Button Configurations**: Users can configure LED indicator modes and button actions, such as jogging or moving to preset positions, for a more intuitive manual interface.
- **Solenoid Control**: Offers control for solenoid-based functions to activate or deactivate motorized components in various experimental setups.

The **KSC101** is a versatile tool for motor control and can be used in applications that range from simple positioning tasks to complex automation sequences, integrating well with optical, mechanical, and experimental setups that require precise motion control.
