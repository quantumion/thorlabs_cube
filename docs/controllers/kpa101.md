# KPA101 
## Piezoelectric Controller for Kinematic Mirror Mounts

The **KPA101** driver by Thorlabs provides precise control of the KPA101 device, which is crucial for aligning laser beams or other optical components in complex optical systems. The **KPA101** offers multiple operational modes to adapt to different requirements, including:

- **Open Loop Mode**: Direct voltage control to adjust actuator position without feedback.
- **Closed Loop Mode**: Position is maintained with a feedback loop, ideal for applications that require stability and precision.

The KPA101 can be controlled manually or via software, enabling integration into automated setups. It also offers various control options, such as setting output voltage, configuring input sources, and adjusting feedback loop parameters, making it versatile for a wide range of precision optical adjustments.

## Integration with Kinematic Mounts
- **Control Modes**: Users can select between different modes to either manually control or automatically stabilize the position of the actuators.
- **Voltage Control**: Provides control over the voltage applied to the actuators, enabling precise movement.
- **Feedback**: In closed-loop mode, position feedback is used to maintain a set position, compensating for any drift that might occur over time.

This driver is particularly useful when coupled with a software driver to automate beam alignment processes, providing sub-micron resolution adjustments.
